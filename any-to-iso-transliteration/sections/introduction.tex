\section{Introduction}

We provide this setup as a minimal example to transliterate from any script (that is supported by
the \texttt{indic\_transliteration} package) to ISO transliteration scheme.

The \texttt{\textbackslash devanagari}, \texttt{\textbackslash bengali}, \texttt{\textbackslash telugu}
and \texttt{\textbackslash kannada} commands and their respective font families are used in this document to render the
text in the original scripts. They are not required if the text is not to be rendered in the original scripts.
Commands like \texttt{\textbackslash iso}, \texttt{\textbackslash Iso} and
\texttt{\textbackslash ISO} can be used to enclose text in any script supported by \texttt{indic\_transliteration}
and the ISO version of the text will be generated using \texttt{finalize.py}.
